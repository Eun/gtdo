Contributing
============

gtdo is an open source project. If you want to contribute to make it better, that's much appreciated!

Filing Issues
-------------

If you find something that is clearly broken, feel free to open an issue.

Contributing Code
-----------------

If you have a bug fix, or a small refactor that makes the code shorter and cleaner, make a pull request. It will be reviewed before merging.

If you'd like to work on a big feature that adds much complexity or code to the project, open an issue to dicuss your idea first. The benfits need to outweight the tradeoffs of additional complexity.
